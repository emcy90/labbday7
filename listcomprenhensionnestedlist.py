a. Using generator Letâ€™s create my_nest_list that
has 3 numbers of list from 0-4 ,5-9 and 10-14. output:
[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10,
11, 12, 13, 14]]
b. Using list comprehension create a list of double value of
even numbers in my_nest_list. output:
[[0, 4, 8], [12, 16], [20, 24, 28]]
c. Using list comprehension create a list of double value of
even numbers in my_list also the number itself if it was
odds in the same order. output :
[[0, 1, 4, 3, 8], [5, 12, 7, 16, 9],
[20, 11, 24, 13, 28]]
d. Repeat a,b,c with tuples, then check if that faster and , if
that save a memory?
e. Using list comprehension flat the nested list my_nest_list
f. Using itertools /chain to flat the same list.
g. Compare timing of both operation using time it , what do
u think ?
